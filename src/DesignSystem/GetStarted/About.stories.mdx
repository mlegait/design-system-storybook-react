# About

This project is a **Proof Of Concept**. The goal is to see how **[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)** can be used to build a **Design System**.

To go faster and because it's a great Design System, all the content is coming from **[IBM's Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/)**.

Here are the original repositories:

- **Carbon website** (guidelines): [https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website)
- **Carbon React components**: [https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/master/packages/react](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/tree/master/packages/react)
