/**
 * - Use text for links rather than graphics or icons.
 * - Links should be three words or less.
 * - Text should be consistent with the title of the intended destination.
 * - Use caution with links that are several words long. It is recommended that links are long enough to be understood by the user, but short enough to prevent text wrapping.
 * - Avoid the term “click here,” other links to “here,” or the web address itself. Instead, use a meaningful descriptive label for the link, and match the destination site name.
