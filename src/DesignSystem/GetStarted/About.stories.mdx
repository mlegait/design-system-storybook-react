# About

This project is a **Proof Of Concept** to see **how Storybook can be used to create the documentation part of a Design System**.

All the content and components have been taken from IBM's **[Carbon Design System](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/)**.

Here is the repository where the original React components used in this project can be found:
